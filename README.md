**Overview**

Our program prompts the user for their name and age and computes the z-score and percentile of their age using predetermined statistics from the most recent U.S. Census. It then prints some output to the console describing the values of theses statistics in a brief message.


**Installation**

Download and open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file in your favorite compatible editor. Run the program and provide the input to your console of choice.


**Usage**

Compile and run the program which will prompt two different inputs to appear in the console. Enter the desired values for each input and press enter to have the program compute the desired statistics. Don't enter a number that isn't an integer for the age prompt as this will cause a run time error.
